# 3-5. Identifier
---
<br>

## 1. The Concept of Identifier
> An entity is a set of instances. When trying to distinguish an instance from an entity, you need a logical name.
> An **'Identifier'** is an <u>*attribute* or *set of attributes*</u> that are used to individually identify each instance of an entity. This is used to pinpoint a single row within an entity.

<br>

## 2. Conditions for Identifier

<table>
  <tr bgcolor="mediumseagreen">
    <td><b>Characteristic</td>
    <td><b>Explanation</td>
    <td><b>Example</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Uniqueness</td>
    <td> - Each instance set that exists in an entity can be uniquely identified by a primary identifier.</td>
    <td>The 'employee_ID' attribute of the 'Employee' entity is the primary identifier. The ID is uniquely assigned to every employee.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Minimality</td>
    <td> - The number of attributes constituting the primary identifier should be minimal within the range that satisfies uniqueness.</td>
    <td>An identifier like the set of 'employee_classCode + employee ID' is inappropriate, because employee_ID alone is already a unique structure.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Immutability</td>
    <td> - The value of the primary identifier should not be changed, once it is set for a specific instance within an entity.</td>
    <td>Once the employee_ID is assigned, it must not be changed to another ID.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Existence</td>
    <td> - If a primary identifier is specified, the data for that attribute must exist(NULL is not allowed).<br>
    </td>
    <td>There is no employee who has no employee_ID.</td>
  </tr> 
</table>
<br>

## 3. Classification of Identifier
> An Identifier can be classified according to whether the '***representative', 'self-generated', 'multiplicity of attributes' and 'replaceability***'.

<br>

<table>
  <tr bgcolor="mediumseagreen">
    <td><b>Criteria</td>
    <td><b>Identifier</td>
    <td><b>Explanation</td>
    <td><b>Example</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td rowspan="2">Representative</td>
    <td>Primary Identifier</td>
    <td> - Can distinguish each row within an entity, <br>
         - Can be linked when it has a reference relationship with another entity.</td>
    <td>employee ID, customer ID</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Alternate Identifier</td>
    <td> - Can distinguish each row within an entity, <br>
         - But cannot be linked with another entity.</td>
    <td>SSN</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td rowspan="2">Self-generated</td>
    <td>Internal Identifier</td>
    <td> - Created by itself inside the entity.</td>
    <td>customer_ID</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Foreign Identifier</td>
    <td> - Received from another entity with which there is a relationship.</td>
    <td>Order<b>.</b>customer_ID</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td rowspan="2">Multiplicity of Attributes</td>
    <td>Single Identifier</td>
    <td> - Composed of one attribute.</td>
    <td>Customer<b>.</b>customer_ID</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Composite Identifier</td>
    <td> - Composed of two or more attributes.</td>
    <td>OrderDetail<b>.</b>(oreder_ID + detail_ID)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td rowspan="2">Replaceability</td>
    <td>Intrinsic Identifier</td>
    <td> - Created by the business.</td>
    <td>customer_ID</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Artificial Identifier</td>
    <td> - Not created by the business.<br>
         - But created artificially, since the intrinsic identifier has a complex configuration.</td>
    <td>Order<b>.</b>order_ID (originally customer_ID + order_ID)</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br>

## 4. Deriving Identifier
#### Identifier Derivation Criteria
<br>

##### ✅ Specify the default identifier as an attribute that is frequently used in the business.
<br>

#####  ✅ Avoid designating a primary identifier as an attribute described by name or place.
<br>

#####  ✅ When using a composite identifier as a primary identifier, make sure that too many attributes are not included.
<br>

## 5. Determination of Identifying Relationships and Non-Identifying Relationships
> - The **identifying relationship** refers to a relationship in which, in two entities <u>in a parent-child relationship, the child entity uses an external identifier (foreign key) from the parent entity as its primary identifier</u>.
> - In general, the case of being a non-Identifying relationship is as follows:
>   - When a child entity is created only when a parent entity is created
> <br>
> - A <b>non-Identifying relationship</b> is a case when a <u>child entity is not using an external identifier as its primary identifier</u>.
> - In general, the case of being a non-Identifying relationship is as follows:
>   - When Attributes received from a parent *are not necessarily required in a child*, so the parentless child can be created.
>   - When it is judged that creating a separate primary identifier from a child entity is more advantageous than making the parent entity's primary identifier as the child's primary identifier.

## 6. Problems in Setting Only the Identifying Relationship

#### ERD When Set Entities Using Only Identifying Relationship
![1](https://i.imgur.com/yWsHL5R.png)
 - When set like this, <u>the number of PK attributes continuously increases</u> whenever a new relationship is derived.
 - It increases either the *complexity of the SQL statement* or the *chance of a mistake* in which the join condition is missed.
<br>

#### ERD When Set Customer ↔ Order as Non-Identifying Relationship
![1](https://i.imgur.com/p23uASq.png)
 - In this ERD,  the order entity is establishing a non-identifier relationship with the customer ID as an external identifier. When configuring like this, the complexity and possibility of errors are reduced when writing SQL statements.
