## 3.1 Data Model

### 1. Modeling
- **Definition**
   - Simplifying and representing our real-world
   - Expressing the structures that abstracts the real-world
   - Clarifying the perspective or Aspects, of existing objects or events, for relevant stakeholders such as person or group.
<br>

- **Features**
  - Abstraction
    - Expresses the complex real-world in a certain format.
  - Simplification
    - Expresses the complex real-world in a notation or language, that complies with the conventions promised by each other.
  - Clarification
    - Clearly describes the complex real world.
    - Removes ambiguity in an easy-to-understand way for various stakeholders.
<br>

### 3. Data Modeling
- Definition
  - Technique to analyze work from the data point of view, to implement real-world business as an IT System.
  - Process of expressing real-world business in a promised notation.
  - Process of analysis and design to build the database, that is the basis of the IT System.
<br>

  > Most IT systems are built on an *RDMS(Relational Database Management System)* basis, and physical database is built based on a data model defined through data modeling. 
  *SQL* statements are used to *input, modify, delete, search* data.

<br>

### 4. Features of data models

  <tr>
    <td>Detailed expression methods</td>
    <td>Provides a way to represent details, specified according to the goal.</td>

#### Importance of data model

    <td>Point</td>
    <td>Explanation</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Leverage</td>
    <td>An inefficient data design which doesn't meet business requirements, will occur huge costs throughout all kinds of processes; development, test, release, operation.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Conciseness</td>
    <td>A well-designed data model enables the clear and precise expression of data requirements in the System.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Quality</td>
    <td>A poorly designed data model leads to data redundancy, inflexibility, and inconsistency, which degrades the quality of data.</td>
  </tr>

<br>

### 5. Progress of Data Modeling

#### Step in Progress
- **Conceptual Data Modeling**
  - Comprehensively modeling targets which to be implemented in the system.
  - This step is often used in data modeling at the enterprise level.
- **Logical Data Modeling**
  - Accurately express the *primary keys, attributes, relationships, foreign keys* to satisfy the business to be implemented.
- **Physical Data Modeling**
  - Based on Logical Data Model, Build a physical database in consideration of physical characteristics: performance, storage space.

    <td>-</td>
  </tr>

<br>

### 7. Data Independency
- **Definition**
  - A property that does not affect the upper level even if the structure of the lower level data is changed.
<br>

- **Necessity of Data Independency**
  - To reduce the complexity and data redundancy of owned data; this can reduce maintenance costs at last.
  - User requirements are updated/modified/deleted continuously, so it's also necessary to maintain independence between the endpoint display and the physical DB.

### 9. The 3 Elements of Data Modeling and Terminology in Data Modeling 
**The 3 Elements of Data Modeling**
 - **Things**
   - Things that involved by specific business.
 - **Attributes**
   - Attributes that something has.
 - **Relationships**
   - Relationships among Things.
<br>

**Terminology Based on the 3 Elements of Data Modeling**

### 10. Steps for Drawing ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram)

1. Draw Entities that needed for business.
2. Place the entities appropriately.
3. Set the relationships among entities.
4. Name each relationship.
5. Describe the degree of participation between relationships.
6. State whether the relationship is essential.
