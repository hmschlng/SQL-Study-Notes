# 3-3. Attribute

<br>

## 1. The Concept of Attribute
  > An Attribute is the smallest data unit that is no longer semantically separated that is needed by the business and that the instance wants to manage.

- **The Scope of Attribute**
  - Attributes are needed by the business.
  - An attribute is a description of an entity and is a component of an instance.
  - An Attribute is semantically-inseparable.
<br>

## 2. Relationship Between Entity / Instance / Attribute / Attribute Value

- **One Entity**** can have ****Mutiple Instances.** 
<br>

- **One Instance**** can have **Multiple Attributes.** 
<br>

- But, **one Attribute** can have only **one Attribute Value.**
<br>

## 4. Conditions for Attribute
#### 1) Must be a piece of information that is necessary to satisfy business requirements, and needs to be stored and managed. (Just like Entity)
  - e.g. 'Station name' attribute of 'subway station' entity.

#### 2) Should have a functional dependency, on the Entity's identifier to which the attribute belongs, According to the normalization theory.
  - e.g. Subway_Station → Station_ID

#### 3) Must have only one value. If not, the values have to be separated into other entities.
  - e.g. Subway_Station is a set of several subway stations, not one.
<br>

## 5. Classification of Attribute
> An attribute can be classified according to **characteristics** or **entity configuration.**<br>
> Classification according to the *characteristics of an attribute* includes a <u>***basic attribute***</u>, a <u>***designed attribute***</u>, and an <u>***derived attribute***</u><br>
> Classification according to the *entity configuration* includes  <u>***PK entity***</u>, <u>***FK entity***</u>, and <u>***normal entity***</u>.

<br>

#### Based on Characteristics

    <td><b>Division</td>
    <td><b>Explanation</td>
    <td><b>Example</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Basic</td>
    <td>Derived from business analysis</td>
    <td>Store<b> . </b>name</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Designed</td>
    <td>Derived from data model design</td>
    <td>Store<b> . </b>standard_industry_code</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Derived</td>
    <td>Calculated / transformed by other attributes</td>
    <td>Store<b> . </b>address <br> → Store<b> . </b>latitude<br> → Store<b> . </b>longitude</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br>

#### Based on Entity Configuration
<table>
    <tr bgcolor="mediumseagreen">
    <td><b>Division</td>
    <td><b>Explanation</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>PK (Primary Key)</td>
    <td>An attribute that can identify only one instance of an entity<br></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>FK (Foreign Key)</td>
    <td>An attribute that included through relationships with other entities</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Normal</td>
    <td>An attribute that exist in entities that are not PK or FK</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br>

#### Example
<table>
    <tr bgcolor="mediumseagreen">
    <td><b>Entity Name</td>
    <td><b>Attribute Class</td>
    <td><b>Attribute Name</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td rowspan="2">Subway Station</td>
    <td>PK</td>
    <td>- Station ID</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Normal</td>
    <td>- Line ID,<br>- Station name</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td rowspan="3">Subway Boarding Information</td>
    <td>PK</td>
    <td>- Staion ID<br>- Date<br>- Departure<br>- Arrival<br>- Boarding code</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>FK</td>
    <td>- Staion ID</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Normal</td>
    <td>- Boarding population</td>
  </tr>
</table>
