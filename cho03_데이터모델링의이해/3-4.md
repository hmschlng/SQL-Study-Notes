## 1. The Concept of Relationship in Data Modeling
> When things interact with each other, we call that state a 'Relationship'. In data modeling, relationships are logical associations between entities that exist within a data model.

<br>

## 2. Relationship Pairing
> - Instances within an entity are individually related. In addition, individual instances can each have different kinds of relationships, which can result in two or more relationships between two entities.
> - The state in which instances within an entity individually have a relationship is called <u>**'relationship pairing'**</u>.
> And this would be logically representated as relationship in ERD.

<br>

## 3. Notation of Relationship
> When Notating, you have to clarify the <u>**'cardinality'**</u> and <u>**'optionality'**</u> of relationships.
> - Cardinality is a <u>number of participants in relationship</u>.<br> → There are the cases of **1:M**, **1:1**, and **M:M**.
> <br>
> - Optionality refers to the <u>dependencies between instances in a relationship</u>.<br> → There are the case of **essential relationship** and **optional relationship**.

<br>

#### Examples of Cardinality

   - One Department can have multiple members.

#### Examples of Optionality

 - **Optional Relationship**
   - From SubwayStation entity, it can either have multiple boarding information, or nothing. In other words, SubwayStation may not have instances of SubwayBoardingInfo. We call this kind of relationship an '***optional relationship***'.
<br>

 - **Essential Relationship**
   - But in contrast, from SubwayBoardingInfo entity, it is necessary to know which subway station has the information of getting on and off the subway. It means that SubwayBoardingInfo needs SubwayStation in any case. We call this kind of relationship an '***essential relationship***'.

## 4. Checklist when defining relationships
 ✅ **Are there association rules of interest between the two entities?**
 ✅ **Does the combination of information occur between the two entities?**
 ✅ **Does the job description or sheet describe the rules for relationship pairing?**
 ✅ **Does the job description or sheet contain the verb that enables relationship pairing?**
